# Project: Titanic Passenger Survival Prediction

This project is dedicated to exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and building machine learning models for the classic Titanic dataset.

Main objectives of the project:
- Explore and analyze passenger data from the Titanic dataset
- Perform feature engineering and data enrichment
- Build machine learning models to predict passenger survival
- Evaluate and analyze model performance and effectiveness

The project is implemented as a complete data science pipeline, including data preprocessing, SQL-based analysis, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling.
