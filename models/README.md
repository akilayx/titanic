## Machine Learning Models
This folder contains machine learning models developed for the task of predicting the survival of Titanic passengers.

### Model objectives:
Predict passenger survival based on demographic and socio-economic features

Compare different machine learning algorithms

Improve model performance through feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning

### Models used:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting

XGBoost (optional)

The final model is selected based on performance metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.
